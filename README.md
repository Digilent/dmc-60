# Digilent DMC 60

The DMC 60 is a powerful and compact motor drive/amplifier designed for robotics, electric vehicles, or any application where easy bidirectional control of DC brushed motors is needed. The DMC 60 is controlled using a standard hobby servo PWM signal - the same output from RC controllers and also easily generated by microcontrollers or FPGA boards. The DMC 60 is approved for use in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) and is designed to be electrically and mechanically compatible with the Victor SP motor controller.
